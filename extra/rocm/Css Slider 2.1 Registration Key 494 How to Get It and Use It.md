A CSS slider is a simple and elegant way to display images or other content on your website. You can use CSS to style the slider, control the transition effects, and add navigation buttons. In this article, we will show you how to create a CSS slider with W3Schools, a popular online platform for learning web development.
 
W3Schools provides a free tool called CSS Slider 2.1 that allows you to create and customize your own slider in minutes. You can choose from different themes, sizes, animations, and captions. You can also preview and download your slider code for free.
